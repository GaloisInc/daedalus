Aside: The DaeDaLus Standard Library
====================================

DaeDaLus, like most modern programming languages, ships with a standard library
of useful parsers and functions. It is quite small, and written entirely in
DaeDaLus itself. This brief section highlights some of the parsers provided,
without digging deeply into their implementation. You'll find this section
useful while working on the extended PNG exercise, particularly for parsing
multi-byte words with the correct endianness.
