This folder contains the sources for the Daedalus manual.

The source for the manual is in `source/index.rst`.

To build a PDF document use:

    make latexpdf

The result will be in a subdirectory of `build`.

To update the documentation on the github pages, use:

    make github

This will build the `html` documentation and copy it to the `docs` folder,
which is what the github pages show.
