MORA Data Messages (MDM) Parser
===============================

This directory contains a parser for much of the MORA Data Messages
(MDM) format, version 2.4, as specified in by Chapter 6 ("MORA DATA
MESSAGING") and related chapters of the Modular Open RF Architecture
Draft Specification, version 2.4, published March 1, 2021.

Status
------

As of the time of this writing, the parser supports all MDM message
types except for VRT, or Type 1. VRT support requires that we have
access to the Vita 49.2 specification which provides the details of the
VRT packet format within MDM. The parser contains many primitive parsers
for various elements of the VRT format, but it does not use them yet
since much of VRT is not parsed. In particular, the `VRT_Message` parser
is unused and is also incomplete.

The parser has been tested on binary test cases from `libmdm`, a C++
implementation of the MDM format. Binary test cases from `libmdm` can be
found in `tests/inputs/`. The `libmdm`'s JSON encoding of the expected
outputs can be found in `tests/outputs/`.

As a next step toward automating testing of the MDM parser using
`libmdm` test cases, we will need to implement a JSON encoder for the
Daedalus parser's AST that matches the output generated by `libmdm`.

The Daedalus parser does not do anything to pretty-print MAC, IPv4, or
IPv6 addresses that it parses in MDM messages. Consequently, the output
will require additional conversion to human-readable strings in order to
be comparable to the `libmdm` JSON encoding.
