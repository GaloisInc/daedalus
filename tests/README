The DaeDaLus Test Suite
=======================

This directory contains the tests for DaeDaLus.
The suite supports two types of tests, differentiated by extension:
  * .ddl files contain a DaeDaLus specification
  * .test files contain command line flags specifying how to invoke deadulus.

The expected output for a test is in a file that has the same name as
the test, except that it has `.stdout` appended at the end.
Thus, the expected output for `T.test` should be in `T.test.stdout` and
the expected output of `S.ddl` would be in `S.ddl.stdout`.

The output of a `.ddl` test is the intermediate representation for
the given specification.

The output of a `.test` file is the result of running `daedalus` with
the given command-line options.  The format of a `.test` file is simple:
each line in the file is a single command line parameter for `daedalus`.

For example, if a test file contains the following two lines
(without white space at the start)

    midi.ddl
    --interp=inputs/confuta.midi

The test will invoke `daedalus midi.ddl --interp=input/confuta.midi`

WARNING: white space in a line is considered to be part of the given argument.
Thus, the following would be INCORRECT:

    midi.ddl
    -i inputs/confuta.midi

The correct way would be to write:

    midi.ddl
    -i
    input/confuta.midi


Invoking Tests
==============

To invoke the test suite, run:

  cabal test

Alternatively, you may use the convenience script `run-test`

  run-test                            # run all tests
  run-test tests/midi                 # run all tests in this directory
  run-test tests/midi/midl.ddl        # run only this test



Adding Tests
============

The easiest way to add a new test is to place the `.ddl` and, optionally
some `.test` files in this `tests/` directory, and then run the test suite.
The intermediate output file (the `.stdout` file) will be in the
`test-output/tests/` directory in the repository root. After verifying
that this file contains the expected output, copy it to the `tests/`
directory.
