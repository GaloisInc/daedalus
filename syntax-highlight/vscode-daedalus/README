This directory contains code to integrate the DaeDaLus LSP server
with Visual Studio Code.

Prerequisites
-------------

To build the extension you'll need `npm` and `libsecret-1-0`

    apt-get update && apt-get install -y npm libsecret-1-0

Building the Extension
----------------------

    npm install vsce && npm install && npm run package

If this is successful you should now have a VSCode extension
called `daedalus-0.0.1.vsix` in the current directory.

Adding the Extension to VS Code
-------------------------------

  1. Open the "Extensions" pane (menu: View / Extensions)
  2. From the `...` menu in "Extensions" select "Install from VSIX"
  3. Navigate to the location of `daedalus-0.0.1.vsix` and select it
  4. Make sure that the `daedalus-language-server` executable is in your path

Test
----

To see the extension in action open a DaeDaLus specification (a `.ddl` file).
VS Code should recognize the file as `Daedalus` (in the bottom status bar).
You should get syntax highlighting for the file, and when you hover
over expressions you should be able to see their type.
