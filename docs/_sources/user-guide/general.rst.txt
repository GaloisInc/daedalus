DaeDaLus Input Format
---------------------

DaeDaLus specification files (i.e. ".ddl" files) can only contain ASCII
characters. That means that all string literals and identifiers for
parsers, semantic values, etc. can only contain ASCII characters. At the
time of this writing, DaeDaLus does not support Unicode characters in
its specification files.
