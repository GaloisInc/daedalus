DaeDaLus User Guide
*******************

DaeDaLus is a language for specifying parsers with data dependencies,
which allows a parser's behavior to be affected by the semantic values
parsed from other parts of the inputs.  This allows a clear, yet precise,
specification of many binary formats.


Declarations
============

A Daedalus specification consists of a sequence of *declarations*.
Each declaration can specify either a *parser*, a *semantic value*, or
a *character class*.  Parsers may examine and consume input, and have
the ability to fail.  If successful, they produce a semantic value.
Character classes describe sets of bytes, which may be used to define
parsers, and will be discussed in more detail `later
<character_classes_>`_.

The general form of a declarations is as follows:

.. code-block:: Daedalus

  def Name Parameters = Definition

The name of a declaration determines what sort of entity it defines:

  * **parsers** always have names starting with an **uppercase** letter,
  * **semantic values** have names starting with a **lowercase** letter,
  * **character classes** have names starting with the symbol ``$``.

Here are some sample declarations:

.. code-block:: Daedalus

  def P   = UInt8       -- a parser named `P`
  def x   = true        -- a semantic value named `x`
  def $d  = '0' .. '9'  -- a character class named `$d`

Single line comments are marked with ``--``, while multi-line comment are
enclosed between ``{-`` and ``-}``, and may be nested.


Parsers
=======


Primitive Parsers
-----------------

**Any Byte.** The parser ``UInt8`` extracts a single byte from the input.
It fails if there are no bytes left in the input.  If successful, it constructs
a value of type ``uint 8``.

**Specific Byte.** The parser ``Match1 $set`` matches a single byte that
belongs to the set of bytes described by ``$set``.

**Specific Byte Sequence.** The parser ``Match bytes`` matches the byte
sequence ``bytes`` in the current input. The resulting semantic value is an
array of bytes, ``[uint 8]``, correspnding to the matched bytes.
For example ``Match "keyword"`` will match ``"keyword"``, while
``Match [0x00,0x01]`` will match two bytes, 0 followed by 1.

**End of Input.** The parser ``END`` succeeds only if there is no more input
to be parsed.  If successful, the result is the trivial semantic value ``{}``.
Normally Daedalus parsers succeed as long as they match a *prefix* of the
entire input.  By sequencing (section `Sequencing Parsers`_) a parser with
``END`` we specify that the entire input must be matched.

**Pure Parsers.** Any semantic value may be turned into a parser that does
not consume any input and always succeeds with the given result.  To do
so prefix the semantic value with the operator ``^``.  Thus, ``^ 'A'`` is
a parser that always succeeds and produces byte ``'A'`` as a result.

**Explicit Failure** The ``Fail`` construct will always fail.  This
parser is parameterized by an optional location, along with an error
message.

**Examples:**

.. code-block:: Daedalus

  {- Declaration                    Matches       Result          -}
  def GetByte     = UInt8           -- Any byte X X
  def TheLetterA  = Match1 'A'      -- Byte 65    65
  def TheNumber3  = Match1 (0 .. 5) -- A byte between 0 to 5
  def TheNumber16 = Match1 0x10     -- Byte 16    16
  def Magic       = Match "HELLO"   -- "HELLO"    [72,69,76,76,79]
  def AlwaysA     = ^ 'A'           -- ""         65
  def GiveUp      = Fail "I give up" -- (none)    Failure with message "I give up"

Sequencing Parsers
------------------

**Basic Sequencing.** Multiple parsers may be executed one after the other,
by listing them either between ``{`` and ``}`` or between ``[`` and ``]``,
and separating them with ``;``.  Thus, ``{ P; Q; R }`` and ``[ P; Q; R ]`` are
both composite parsers that will execute ``P`` , then ``Q``, and finally ``R``.
If any of the sequenced parsers fails, then the whole sequence fails.

Parsers sequenced with ``[]`` produce an array, with each element of the
array containing the result of the corresponding parser.
Since all elements in an array have the same type, all parsers sequenced
with ``[]`` should construct the same type of semantic value.

By default, parsers sequenced with ``{}`` return the result of the last
parser in the sequence.

Examples:

.. code-block:: Daedalus

  {- Declaration                       Matches        Result      -}
  def ABC1 = { 'A'; 'B'; 'C' }      -- "ABC"          67
  def ABC2 = [ 'A'; 'B'; 'C' ]      -- "ABC"          [65,66,67]
  def ABC3 = { "Hello"; "ABC" }     -- "HelloABC"     [65,66,67]
  def ABC4 = { "Hello"; 'C' }       -- "HelloC"       67

**Explicit Result.** A ``{}``-sequenced group of parsers may return
the result from any member of the group instead of the last one.  To do so,
assign the result of the parser to the special variable ``$$``.  For example,
``{ P; $$ = Q; R }`` specifies that the group's result should come from
``Q`` instead of ``R``.   It is an error to assign ``$$`` more than once.


**Local Variables.** It is also possible to combine the results of some
of the ``{}``-sequenced parsers by using *local variables* and the pure parser.
Assignments starting with the symbol ``@`` introduce a local variable,
which is in scope in the following parsers.  Here is an example:

.. code-block:: Daedalus

  def Add = {
    @x = UInt8;
    Match1 '+';
    @y = UInt8;
    ^ x + y
  }

The parser ``Add`` is a sequence of 4 parsers.  The local variables ``x``
and ``y`` store the results of the first and the third parser.  The result
of the sequence is the result of the last parser, which does not consume
any input, but only constructs a semantic value by adding ``x`` and ``y``
together.

**Structure Sequence.** It is also possible to return results from more than
one of the parsers in a ``{}``-sequenced group.  To do so give names to the
desired results (*without* ``@``).  The semantic value of the resulting parser
is a structure with fields containing the value of the correspondingly
named parsers.  Consider, for example, the following declaration:

.. code-block:: Daedalus

  def S = { x = UInt8; y = Match "HELLO" }

This declaration defines a parser named ``S``, which will extract a
byte followed by the sequence ``"HELLO"``. The result of this parser is
a *structure type*, also named ``S``, which has two fields, ``x`` and ``y``:
``x`` is a byte, while ``y`` is an array of bytes.

Note that structure fields also introduce a local variable with the same name,
so later parsers in the sequence may depend on the semantic values in
earlier parsers in the sequence.  For example:

.. code-block:: Daedalus

  def S1 = { x = UInt8; y = { @z = UInt8; ^ x + z } }

The parser ``S1`` is a sequence of two parsers, whose semantic value
is a structure with two fields, ``x`` and ``y``.  Both fields have type
``uint 8``.  The first parser just extracts a byte from input.  The second
parser is itself a sequence: first it extracts a byte from the input,
but its semantic value is the sum of the two extracted bytes.  As another
example, here is an equivalent way to define the same parser:

.. code-block:: Daedalus

  def S2 = { x = UInt8; @z = UInt8; y = ^ x + z }


**Syntactc Sugar.** A number of the constructs described in this section are
simply syntactic sugar for using local variables.  Here are some examples:

+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Expression:          |  Equivalent to:                                 |
+======================+=================================================+
| ``{ $$ = P; Q }``    | ``{ @x = P;        Q; ^ x                }``    |
+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| ``[ P; Q ]``         | ``{ @x0 = P; @x1 = Q; ^ [x0,x1]          }``    |
+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| ``{ x = P; y = Q }`` | ``{ @x = P;  @y  = Q; ^ { x = x; y = y } }``    |
+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+


Parsing Alternatives
--------------------

**Biased Choice.** Given two parsers ``P`` and ``Q`` we may construct
the composite parser ``P <| Q``.   This parser succeeds if *either*
``P`` *or* ``Q`` succeeds. In the case that *both* succeed, the parser behaves
like ``P``.  Note that ``P`` and ``Q`` have to construct semantic values of
the same type.

More operationally, ``P`` would be used to parse the input first,
and only if it fails would we execute ``Q`` on the same input.  While this
may be a useful intuition about the behavior of this parser, the actual
parsing algorithm might implement this behavior in a different way.

Here are some examples:

.. code-block:: Daedalus

  {- Declaration            Matches        Result   -}
  def B1 = Match1 'A'   -- "A"            'A', or
        <| Match1 'B'   -- "B"            'B'

  def B2 = Match1 'A'
        <| ^ 'B'        -- "A"            'A', or
                        -- ""             'B'

These two are quite different:  ``B1`` will fail unless the
next byte in the input is ``'A'`` or ``'B'``, while ``B2`` never fails.


**Unbiased Choice.** Given two parsers ``P`` and ``Q`` we may construct
the composite parser ``P | Q``.  This parser succeeds if either ``P`` or ``Q``
succeeds on the given input.   Unlike biased choice, if *both* succeed,
then the resulting parser is *ambigous* for the given input, which means
that input may be parsed in more than one way.  It is possible, however, to
resolve ambiguities by composing (e.g., in sequence) with other parsers.

Here are some examples:

.. code-block:: Daedalus

  def U1 = Match1 'A' | ^ 0
  def U2 = { U1; 'B' }

Parser ``U1`` on its own is ambiguous on inputs starting with ``"A"`` because
it could produce either ``'A`` (by consuming it from the input),
or ``0`` (by consuming nothing).  This happens because parsers only need
to match a prefix of the input to succeed.

Parser ``U2`` accepts inputs starting with either ``"AB"`` (by using the
left alternative of ``U1``) or starting with ``"B"`` (by using the right
alternative of ``U1``).  No inputs are ambiguous in this case.



**Alternative Syntax.** Given multiple parsers ``A``, ``B``, ... we can use 
the ``Choose`` keyword for unbiased choice and ``Choose1`` for biased choice. 

+---------------------------+-------------------+ 
| Expression:               | Equivalent to:    | 
+===========================+===================+ 
| ``Choose { A ; B; ...}``  | ``A | B | ...``   | 
+---------------------------+-------------------+ 
| ``Choose1 { A ; B; ... }``| ``A <| B <| ...`` |
+---------------------------+-------------------+

Choose can also be used to construct tagged unions: see below. 


Control Structures 
==================

Guards
------

Boolean semantic values may be used as a guard to control whether parsing
continues. For example, the following parser uses the guard
``(i - '0') > 5 is true`` to distinguish whether an parsed digit is
greater than 5.

.. code-block:: Daedalus 

  {
    @i = '0'..'9';
    Choose1 { 
        { (i - '0') > 5 is true; ^ "input gt 5";} ; 
        { ^ "input leq 5";}
    }
  }

So, if ``p`` is a boolean value, then ``p is true`` is a parser that
succeeds without consuming input if ``p`` holds, and fails otherwise.
Similarly, ``p is false`` is a parser that would succeed only
if ``p`` is ``false``.



``for`` loops
-------------

The ``for`` construct can be used to iterate over collections (arrays
and dictionaries).  A for-loop declares a local variable representing
the accumulated result of the computation, and a variable that is
bound to the elements of the collection.  The body may be a parser, or
a semantic value.  For example, the following expression sums the
values in an array of integers:

.. code-block:: Daedalus 

  for (val = 0 : int; v in [1,2,3]) 
    val + v
    
Here, ``val`` is initially bound to ``0``. Each iteration of the loop binds
``v`` to the current element of the sequence, then computes the value of the
body, ``val + v``. This returned value is the updated value of ``val``.

Another way to understand how this works is to see the following expression,
which is the result of one step of evaluation: 

.. code-block:: Daedalus 

  for (val = 1; v in [2, 3]) 
    val + v

``for`` supports an alternative form which binds both the index and
value of a collection. For example, the following loop multiplies 
each element in the sequence by its index: 

.. code-block:: Daedalus 

  for (val = 0; i,v in [1,2,3]) 
    val + (i * v)  

This construct is also useful when iterating over the contents of
dictionaries, where the index is bound to the key.  The following
loop is a parser which fails when the value is less than the key:

.. code-block:: Daedalus 

  for (val = 0; k,v in d) 
    k <= v is true

    
Map
---

Daedalus supports another iteration construct, ``map``. This performs an operation on each 
element of a sequence, resulting in a sequence of results. For example, the following code 
doubles each element in an array: 

.. code-block:: Daedalus

  map (x in [1:int, 2, 3]) 
    2 * x

The ``map`` construct can be used to parse a sequence of blocks, based on a
sequence of values. For example the following code parses blocks of the form ``0AAA...``, 
with the number of ``'A'`` characters dicated by the input sequence. 

.. code-block:: Daedalus 

  map (x in [1, 2, 3]) {
    Match1 '0'; 
    Many x (Match1 'A');
  }

Just as with ``for``, the map construct has an alternative form that includes both 
sequence indexes and values: 

.. code-block:: Daedalus 

  map (i,x in [5, 2, 1]) {
    Match1 '0'; 
    len       = ^ { index = i, elem = x };
    something = Many x (Match1 'A');
  }


Unions and Case Distinction
---------------------------

Daedalus supports tagged unions and case distinction on unions. The way to
construct a union is to use ``Choose``. For example, the following parser
constructs a union with possible tags ``good`` and ``bad``,
depending on whether the input character is ``'G'`` or ``'B'``. 

.. code-block:: Daedalus 

  Choose { 
    good = 'G';
    bad = 'B'; 
  }

It is also possible to construct a union literal using ``{| good = 'G' |}``.
Note however that the compiler will reject programs where it cannot infer
the resulting type of the union.  In such cases, you'd need to provide
an explicit type signature.

Given a union ``u`` and tag name ``t``, the guard ``u is t`` succeeds
if the union has the correct tag. This can be used to control parser
control flow, as in the following example: 

.. code-block:: Daedalus 

  { 
    @res = Choose { 
      good = 'G';
      bad = 'B'; 
    }; 
    Choose { 
      {res is good; ^ "Success!"}; 
      {res is bad; ^ "Failure!"}; 
    } 
  }

The result of a succesful ``is`` guard is the value of the union
element.  For example

.. code-block:: Daedalus 

  { 
    @res = Choose { 
      good = { 'G'; Many (Match1 'a' .. 'z') };
      bad =   'B' ;
    }; 
    Choose { 
      { @msg = res is good; ^ (concat [ "Success!", msg])}; 
      { res is bad; ^ "Failure!" }; 
    }
  }

  
Commit
------

Normally, at the point a parser fails, Daedalus will backtrack to a choice point 
and try an alternative parser. The ``commit`` guard acts as a cut-point and prevents
backtracking. For example, the following code cannot parse the string ``"AC"`` 
because parsing ``'A'`` and the subsequent ``commit`` will prevent backtracking 
reaching the alternative branch. 

.. code-block:: Daedalus 

  Choose1 { 
    { Match1 'A'; commit; Match1 'B' }; 
    { Match1 'A'; Match1 'C' }  -- Can't happen 
  }

The ``try`` construct converts commit failure into parser failure.  A
commit failure will propagate until it hits an enclosing ``try``
construct, or until it escapes the top-level definition.
  
Option type 
-----------

Daedalus supports the special polymorphic type ``maybe A``, which has possible 
values ``nothing`` and ``just i``, for some value of type ``A``.
The ``is`` guard can be used to identify which case holds.

.. code-block:: Daedalus 

  { 
    @res = 
      {@l = Match1 ('A'..'Z'); ^ just l}
        <|
      {^ nothing};
    r = res is just
  }

The above example could also be written using the builtin ``Optional`` parser.

.. code-block:: Daedalus 

  { 
    @res = Optional (Match1 'A'..'Z');
    r = res is just
  }

Semantic Values
===============

If successful, a parser produces a semantic value, which describes the
input in some way useful to the application invoking the parser.
In addition, semantic values may be used to control how other parts of the
input are to be parsed.  Daedalus has a number of built-in semantic values
types, and allows for user-defined record and union types.

Booleans
--------

The type ``bool`` classifies the usual boolean values ``true`` and ``false``.

The operator ``!`` may be used to negate a boolean value.

Boolean values may be compared for equality using ``==``.




Numeric Types
-------------

Daedalus supports a variety of numeric types: ``int``, ``uint N``, and
``sint N``, the latter two being families of types indexed by a number.
The type ``int`` classifies integers of arbitrary size.
The ``uint N`` classify unsigned numbers that can be represented using ``N``
bits and ``sint N`` is for signed numbers that can be represented
in ``N`` bits.

Literals of the numeric types may written either using decimal or hexadecimal
notation (e.g., ``10`` or ``0xA``).  The type of a literal can be inferred
from the context (e.g., ``10`` can be used as both ``int`` a ``uint 8``).

Numeric types support basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, division, and modulus using the usual operators
``+``,``-``,``*``,``/``, and ``%``.  DaeDaLus also supports shift
operations ``<<`` and ``>>``.
These operations are overloaded and can be used on all numeric types,
with the restriction that the inputs and the outputs must be of the
same type.  

Numeric types can also be compared for equality, using ``==`` and ordering
using ``<``, ``<=``, ``>``, and ``>=``.

Unsigned integers may also be treated as bit-vectors, and support various
bitwise operations: complement: ``~``; exclusive-or ``^``; and bitwise-and ``&``.

Unsigned numbers can also be appended to other numbers via the
``#`` and ``<#`` operator.  To see the difference between the two,
consider two bitvectors ``(x : uint A)`` and ``(y : uint B)``.
The result of ``x # y`` is a bitvector of type ``A + B`` with
``x`` in the more significatn bits, and ``y`` in the less significant bits.
The result of ``x <# y`` is a bitvector of type ``A`` that contains
``x # y`` but truncated to the ``A`` less significatn bits.



Stream manipulation
===================

Daedalus parsers operate on an *input stream*, which by default is the input
data to the parser. However, the input stream can be manipulated directly. For example, 
we can write a parser function which runs two different parsers on the same stream. 

.. code-block:: Daedalus 

  def ParseTwice P1 P2 = {
    @cur = GetStream; 
    p1result = P1; 
    SetStream cur; 
    p2result = P2; 
  }

By manipulating the stream, we can also run a parser on a fixed-size sub-stream.
The following parser parses a size-n chunk which begins with a sequence of
letters, and then is filled with spaces: 

.. code-block:: Daedalus 

  def LetterFill n = { 
    @cur = GetStream; 
    @this = Take n cur; 
    @next = Drop n cur; 
    SetStream this; 
    $$ = { $$ = Many (Match1 ('A'..'Z'))
            Many (Match1 ' '); 
            END; }; 
    SetStream next; 
  }

It is also possible to directly access the current position in the stream using
``Offset``. This can be used to calculate how many characters were read by a
particular parser: 

.. code-block:: Daedalus 

  def OffsetTest = { 
      a = Offset; 
      Match "AA";
      b = Offset; 
      Match "AAA"; 
      c = Offset; 
  }
  -- Result: { a:0, b:2, c:5 } 

The ``arrayStream`` operator converts an array into a stream:

.. code-block:: Daedalus 

  def CatStream a b = { 
      SetStream (arrayStream (concat [a, b]));
      Match "AA";
      Match "BBB";
      ^ {}
  }

This example will succeed if the concatenation of the arrays ``a`` and
``b`` starts with the string ``"AABBB"``.
