This directory contains an LSP server for DaeDaLus.

For instructions on how to use this server with VS Code, please look at
the README in `syntax-highlight/vscode-daedalus`

To use this with neovim, you will need the `lspconfig` plugin; then an LSP
config for daedalus is available in the `nvim` directory. For example, with the
`vim-plug` package manager, you would put something like this in `init.vim`:

    call plug#begin()
    Plug 'neovim/nvim-lspconfig'
    Plug 'GaloisInc/daedalus', {'rtp': 'daedalus-language-server/nvim'}
    call plug#end()
    lua lsp.daedalus.setup {}

Don't forget to `cabal install` and make sure the `daedalus-language-server`
executable is on your `$PATH`. See the [`lspconfig`
documentation](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig#Suggested-configuration)
for suggestions on setting up keybindings.
